# Atoms

## Building Blocks of the UI

Atoms are the basic building blocks of the interface - the smallest, most fundamental components. They cannot be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional.

## Philosophy

In Atomic Design, atoms are analogous to atoms in chemistry. They're simple, standalone elements that serve as the foundation for everything else. Each atom has a single, well-defined purpose.

## Examples in this Library

### Form Controls

- **Button** - Clickable action triggers with multiple styles
- **Input** - Text input fields for various data types
- **Checkbox** - Two-state selection control
- **Radio** - Single selection from multiple options
- **Switch** - Toggle between on/off states
- **Textarea** - Multi-line text input

### Content & Display

- **Label** - Text labels for form fields
- **Badge** - Status indicators and tags
- **Avatar** - User profile images with fallbacks
- **Icon** - SVG icons from Lucide
- **Spinner** - Loading indicators
- **Divider** - Visual separators

### Interactive

- **Menu** - Dropdown menu items
- **Popover** - Floating content containers
- **Tooltip** - Contextual help text

## Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each atom does one thing well
2. **Reusability**: Can be used anywhere in the application
3. **No Business Logic**: Pure presentational components
4. **Themeable**: Support light, dark, and custom themes
5. **Accessible**: Built with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

## Usage

Atoms are typically composed together to form molecules and organisms. They can also be used standalone when a simple, atomic component is all that's needed.

```typescript
// Example: Using atoms standalone
<button mmcButton>Click me</button>
<mmc-checkbox [(ngModel)]="checked"></mmc-checkbox>
<input mmcInput type="text" />
```

## Built With

Many atoms in this library leverage:

- **ng-primitives** - For accessible, headless UI primitives
- **@angular/cdk** - For advanced component behaviors
- **Tailwind CSS** - For consistent styling
