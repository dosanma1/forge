# Organisms

## Complex UI Sections

Organisms are groups of molecules and/or atoms joined together to form relatively complex, distinct sections of an interface. They are the building blocks of application layouts.

## Philosophy

In Atomic Design, organisms are distinct interface sections that typically contain a header, content area, and often represent standalone features or functionalities.

## Examples in this Library

### Navigation & Layout

- **Side Bar** - Application navigation with menu items and user profile
- **Theme Manager** - Theme selection with color customization

### Data Management

- **Table** - Complex data tables with sorting, filtering, and pagination
- **Sort** - Sorting controls for data collections

## Design Principles

1. **Distinct Sections**: Clear, recognizable interface sections
2. **Composed Functionality**: Combines multiple molecules and atoms
3. **Context-Specific**: Often tied to specific application features
4. **Reusable Patterns**: Can be reused across different contexts
5. **Business Logic**: May contain application-specific logic

## Complexity Levels

Organisms represent a significant jump in complexity from molecules:

- **Molecules**: 2-4 atoms working together
- **Organisms**: Multiple molecules + atoms forming complete interface sections

## Usage

Organisms are used when you need a complete, standalone section of the UI. They're typically more specific to your application's domain.

```typescript
// Example: Theme Manager organism
<mmc-theme-manager [themes]="themeOptions">
  // Combines: Select dropdown + Color pickers + State management
</mmc-theme-manager>

// Example: Data Table organism
<mmc-table
  [data]="users"
  [columns]="columnConfig"
  [sortable]="true"
  [filterable]="true">
  // Combines: Headers + Rows + Sort controls + Pagination
</mmc-table>

// Example: Sidebar organism
<mmc-side-bar>
  // Combines: Navigation menu + User profile + Theme switcher
</mmc-side-bar>
```

## When to Use Organisms

- **Complete Features**: The component represents a complete, recognizable feature
- **High Complexity**: Requires coordination between multiple molecules
- **Application-Specific**: Contains domain logic or application-specific behavior
- **Standalone**: Can function independently as a section of the interface

## Beyond Organisms

In the complete Atomic Design methodology:

- **Templates**: Page-level structure combining organisms
- **Pages**: Specific instances of templates with real content

These are typically implemented at the application level rather than in the component library.

## State Management

Organisms often manage more complex state than molecules:

- User interactions across multiple sub-components
- Data fetching and caching
- Application-specific business logic
- Integration with services and stores
