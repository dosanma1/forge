# Molecules

## Combining Atoms into Functional Units

Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together to create the smallest fundamental units of a compound. They take on their own properties and serve as the backbone of the design system.

## Philosophy

In Atomic Design, molecules are simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit. While atoms have a single purpose, molecules begin to take on more complex behaviors through composition.

## Examples in this Library

### User Interaction

- **Alert** - Notification messages with icons and actions
- **Confirmation Dialog** - Modal dialogs for user confirmations
- **Drawer** - Slide-out panels for additional content
- **Tab** - Tabbed navigation and content organization

### Form Components

- **Form Field** - Label + Input + Error message composition
- **Select** - Dropdown selection with search
- **Select with Search** - Enhanced select with filtering
- **Listbox** - Keyboard-navigable option lists

### Compound Controls

- **Inputs** - Grouped input fields with labels
- **Button Group** - Related buttons grouped together

## Design Principles

1. **Composition**: Built from multiple atoms working together
2. **Single Purpose**: Each molecule serves a specific function
3. **Reusable Patterns**: Common UI patterns abstracted into components
4. **Contextual**: Provide more context than atoms alone
5. **Stateful**: May manage their own internal state

## Usage

Molecules are used to create common UI patterns that appear throughout the application. They encapsulate both structure and basic behavior.

```typescript
// Example: Alert molecule (Icon + Text + Close button)
<mmc-alert variant="info">
  <mmc-icon name="lucideInfo"></mmc-icon>
  <span>Your changes have been saved</span>
  <button mmcButton size="sm">Dismiss</button>
</mmc-alert>

// Example: Form field molecule (Label + Input + Error)
<mmc-form-field>
  <label mmcLabel>Email</label>
  <input mmcInput type="email" />
  <span class="error">Invalid email</span>
</mmc-form-field>
```

## When to Use Molecules vs Atoms

- **Use an Atom** when you need a single, standalone element
- **Use a Molecule** when you need a combination of atoms that frequently appear together
- Molecules should still be relatively simple - if it's getting complex, consider an organism

## Accessibility

All molecules inherit accessibility features from their atomic components and add:

- Proper ARIA relationships between related elements
- Keyboard navigation for compound controls
- Screen reader announcements for state changes
